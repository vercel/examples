# Vercel Examples Upgrade Guide

Welcome to the Vercel Examples repository! This guide is designed to help you understand the project, get started with contributions, and explore potential upgrades.

## Getting Started

This repository is a collection of example applications that demonstrate how to use Vercel's features and services. The examples are organized into several directories, including `starter`, `solutions`, and `edge-middleware`.

### Exploring the Examples

To get started, we recommend exploring the `starter` directory. These examples are designed to be simple and easy to understand. A good one to start with is `turborepo-with-hono`, which demonstrates a monorepo setup with a Hono API and a Next.js web application.

Each example has its own `README.md` file that explains how to run it. Be sure to read this file before you begin.
