# .github Directory

This directory contains configuration files and templates for GitHub-specific features and workflows.

## Purpose and Usage

The files within the `.github` directory are used to manage various aspects of the repository, such as code ownership, pull request templates, dependency updates, and continuous integration workflows.

## Files

- `.github/CODEOWNERS`: Defines the code owners for the repository. Code owners are automatically requested for review when someone opens a pull request that modifies code they own.
- `.github/pull_request_template.md`: Provides a template for pull request descriptions. This helps ensure that pull requests contain all the necessary information for reviewers.
- `.github/renovate.json`: Configuration file for Renovate, a tool that automates dependency updates. This file defines the rules and settings for how dependencies should be updated.
- `.github/workflows/publish-template.yaml`: GitHub Actions workflow for publishing templates. This workflow automates the process of publishing templates to the repository.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow for releasing new versions of the repository. This workflow automates the process of creating and publishing releases.
