### Clone and Deploy

You can clone just this directory using:

```bash

cd express-weather-mcp-server
```

Run the Express app in development mode:

First install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli). You will need to link the code with a Vercel project.

```bash
vercel dev
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=vercel-examples) ([Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs)).
