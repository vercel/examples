# Routes
### Build Output API

This Prebuilt Deployment example demonstrates how to output Vercel Routes using the Build Output API.

Routing configuration is specified in the [`.vercel/output/config.json`](./.vercel/output/config.json) file under
the `routes` property.

In this case, there is a route that implements an HTTP redirect to https://example.com.

There are many more use-cases that routing configuration can solve as well.
