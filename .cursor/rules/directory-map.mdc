# Directory purpose map

Use this when you need to figure out where a change belongs. It groups the busiest
top-level folders and notes what lives inside.

## Product surfaces

- `apps/vibe-coding-platform` (sometimes referenced as `apps/wipecodingplatform`
  in planning docs): The primary Next.js app that powers the AI coding
  experience. Contains the chat UI, AI tool wiring (`ai/*`), server actions, and
  sandbox viewer flows. Treat this as the source of truth for frontend behavior
  and user interaction logic.
- `app-directory/`, `framework-boilerplates/`, `starter/`, `solutions/`, `microfrontends/`,
  `vercel-tutor/`: Reference apps and learning sandboxes that mirror various
  Vercel example repos. When in doubt, treat them as read-only templates unless a
  change request explicitly targets them.
- `edge-middleware/`, `flags-sdk/`, `storage/`, `toolbar/`: Vertical-specific
  showcases for middleware, feature flag helpers, storage adapters, and the
  floating toolbar UI respectively. These are mostly self-contained Next or Edge
  projects that share little code with the main app.

## Backends and runtimes

- `python/`: Collection of backend templates. The important one for active work
  is `python/vibe-coding-ide/backend` (often shortened to `python/backend` in
  docs). It hosts the Python agent service: `src/agent` defines the task-running
  agent, `src/api` exposes REST endpoints, `src/sandbox` contains command/runtimes,
  and `server.py` boots the FastAPI-style server. Other subfolders (`fastapi/`,
  `flask*/`, `hello-world/`, `nextjs-flask/`) are deployable samples.
- `internal/`: Shared TypeScript utilities plus any cross-cutting adapters that
  multiple apps import (telemetry, shared hooks, schemas, etc.).
- `build-output-api/`: Markdown specs that document how each example emits the
  Vercel Build Output API artifacts. Useful when adjusting deployment behavior.

## Tooling and ops

- `ci-cd/`: GitHub Actions plus other automation recipes. Edit here when the
  request is about deployment workflows or release automation.
- `guides/`: Short HOWTOs and guardrails for maintainers—useful context before
  modifying complex systems.
- `plop-templates/` & `plopfile.mjs`: Scaffolding scripts/templates used to spin
  up new example apps. Update when adding a fresh template that should be
  generated via Plop.

## Notes when routing work

1. Frontend product changes almost always touch `apps/vibe-coding-platform` (app
   directory routes + shared `components/`).
2. Backend agent or sandbox execution changes belong in
   `python/vibe-coding-ide/backend`.
3. Most other directories are reference material—avoid edits unless a task calls
   for a documentation or template update.
