# A/B Testing Simple

By A/B testing at the edge, you'll reduce layout shift from client-loaded experiments and improve your site's performance with smaller JavaScript bundles.

## Demo

https://edge-functions-ab-testing-simple.vercel.app

Since the different variants are generated statically at the edge, it mitigates any potential layout shift that could happen when a variant is inserted into the DOM client side, hence improving your site's performance.

Take a look at [`middleware.ts`](middleware.ts) to see how it works.
