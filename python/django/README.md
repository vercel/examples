# Django + Vercel

This example shows how to use Django 6 on Vercel with Serverless Functions using the [Python Runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python).

## Demo

https://django-template.vercel.app/

## How it Works

Our Django application, `example` is configured as an installed application in `config/settings.py`:

```python
# config/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    "example",
]
```

We allow `*.vercel.app` subdomains in `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, in addition to `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`:

```python
# config/settings.py
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["127.0.0.1", "localhost", ".vercel.app"]
```

There is a single view which renders the current time in `example/views.py`:

```python
# example/views.py
from datetime import datetime

from django.http import HttpResponse


def index(request):
    now = datetime.now()
    html = f"""
    <html>
        <body>
            <h1>Hello from Vercel!</h1>
            <p>The current time is { now }.</p>
        </body>
    </html>
    """
    return HttpResponse(html)
```

This view is exposed through `example/urls.py`:

```python
# example/urls.py
from django.urls import path

from example.views import index


urlpatterns = [
    path("", index),
]
```

Finally, it's made accessible to the Django server inside `config/urls.py`:

```python
# config/urls.py
from django.urls import path, include


urlpatterns = [
    path("", include("example.urls")),
]
```

This example uses the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) with Django to enable handling requests on Vercel with Serverless Functions.

## Running Locally

```bash
uv sync
uv run python manage.py runserver
```

Your Django application is now available at `http://localhost:8000`.
