### Adding a new example

To quickly start contributing with a new example, run the following commands:

```bash
npm i
npm run new-example
```

#### The pre-commit hook


We use [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) to manage the pre-commit [Git hook](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) in this repo. Husky configures hooks automatically during install, so you don't need to do anything special to get them working, but if it fails to install, you can run the following command to install it manually:

```bash
npm run prepare
```
